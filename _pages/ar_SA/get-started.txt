### Required Reading

These steps will prepare your SD card for installing Coldboot Haxchi custom firmware.

Before beginning, you should make sure your Wii U is currently on firmware 5.5.0, 5.5.1 or 5.5.2. Older versions aren't currently supported.

Your SD card is recommended to be at least 16GB or 32GB to have enough space for dumping and installing games. If you want to make a backup of your Wii U's system in case it needs to be restored in the future, you will need an SD card at least twice the size of your Wii U's system memory (16GB SD card for an 8GB white console; 64GB SD card for a 32GB black console).

Your SD card must be formatted as FAT32 (Allocation Unit Size of 32K). Most SD cards will be formatted this way by default.

If you need to format an SD card on Windows, do not use the built in formatter or it may cause issues. Use [guiformat](http://www.ridgecrop.demon.co.uk/index.htm?guiformat.htm) instead and set to an Allocation Unit Size of 64KB.

Your SD card *cannot* be named `wiiu`, or it will cause problems.

Before starting, you may want to check your SD card for errors using [H2testw (Windows)](h2testw-(windows)), [F3 (Linux)](f3-(linux)), or [F3X (Mac)](f3x-(mac))!

#### Section II - DS Virtual Console Game

There are two methods for using Wii U custom firmware.

The first method is to run a browser exploit through the browser which will patch the system. Unfortunately, the nature of this exploit is that this *must* be run after every reboot. Additionally, the browser exploit compatible with 5.5.2 is very unreliable making this an even less usable option.

The second method is to purchase a very cheap exploitable DS Virtual Console game to launch your Custom Firmware automatically at boot. This is *essentially required* for users on 5.5.2 because of the aforementioned instability with the 5.5.2 browser exploit.

The DS Virtual Console game *must* be a **legitimately purchased** copy of the game installed to the **internal memory** of your device. You *cannot* install this DS Virtual Console game to a USB drive.

If you want to use the DS Virtual Console method, you should purchase the game before proceeding to the next section.
{: .notice--primary}

The following DS Virtual Console games are compatible:

| Compatible Haxchi Games |
| ------------- |
| Animal Crossing: Wild World |
| Big Brain Academy |
| Brain Age |
| DK: Jungle Climber |
| Dr. Kawashima's Brain Training |
| Kirby: Canvas Curse |
| Kirby: Mass Attack|
| Kirby: Squeak Squad / Kirby: Mouse Attack |
| Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass |
| Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks |
| Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time |
| Mario Kart DS |
| New Super Mario Bros. |
| Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of the Sky |
| Pokemon Ranger |
| Pokemon Ranger: Guardian Signs | 
| Pokemon Ranger: Shadows of Almia |
| Starfox Command |
| Super Mario 64 DS |
| Wario: Master of Disguise |
| WarioWare: Touched |
| Yoshi's Island DS |
| Yoshi's Touch & Go |

Currently, Brain Age is the cheapest of these titles on the eShop ($6.99 USD).

If already own Brain Age or Brain Training and have had it installed on your Wii U for a while, try deleting it and redownloading the game from the eShop. Older versions of the game are not compatible with the exploit.

#### Section III - Block System Updates

Note that, to access the eShop with these DNS addresses set, you must first run NNU-Patcher through the Homebrew Launcher. Additionally note that NNU-Patcher is a temporary patch and will need to be ran again if you need to access the eShop after a reboot.

Note that, unless you block updates with this method on all current and future connections, updates on the Wii U are performed *automatically* and *cannot* be disabled. 
{: .notice--danger}

1. Go to the "System Settings", then "Internet", then "Connect to the Internet" then press (X) to display your current network connections
1. For each of your connections (and all future connections), do the following
  + Select the connection
  + Select "Change Settings"
  + Move to the second list and choose "DNS"
  + Set the DNS to "Don't Auto-Obtain"
  + Set the DNS server IPs to the following servers
  + {:.bigdns} `168.235.092.108`
  + {:.bigdns} `081.004.127.020`
  + Select "Confirm", then press (B) to save
  + These servers will block your SysNAND from being updated
