### Required Reading

Haxchi is a custom firmware that patches signature checks, region checks, and runs other custom code in the background.

Haxchi is an exploit that allows us to launch CFW directly from the system menu without using the Homebrew Launcher.

### What You Need

+ A legitimate copy of one of the exploitable DS virtual console games installed to your Wii U's internal memory
  + If you do not already have one of the exploitable games installed, see [Get Started](get-started)
+ The custom `config.txt` provided in [Get Started](get-started) (*not* the default Haxchi `config.txt`) should already be in the `/haxchi/` folder on your SD card
  + Using the default config (from the Haxchi `.zip`) will cause your Haxchi installation to behave differently than expected
  
### Instructions

1. Launch the Haxchi Installer
1. Select the DS virtual console game you are installing Haxchi onto, then press (A) to select it
1. Read the warning that appears, then press (A) to install
1. Once this is complete, launch your Haxchi DS virtual console game (named "Haxchi")
1. The console will reboot and enable custom firmware features
  + This will allow unsigned titles (such as the Homebrew Launcher) to be launched directly from the system menu

___

Currently, you must launch the DS virtual console game every time you reboot in order to enter custom firmware. The next page will optionally install Coldboot Haxchi which can do this automatically on boot.

**You can now hold various buttons while launching your DS virtual console game for different boot options. This is what each of the boot options do:**

  + None -> Reboots into custom firmware
  + (A) -> Reboots into the Homebrew Launcher
