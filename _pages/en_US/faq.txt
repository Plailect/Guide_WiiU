<a name="faq_latestfw" />**Q:** *I am on the latest system version, is my device hackable?*    
**A:** No. The latest hackable firmware is currently 5.5.1. If you alread have CFW installed (Haxchi, CBHC), you are fine updating though.
<br><br>
<a name="faq_oldfw" />**Q:** *I have a Wii U on X.X.X firmware. What can / should  I do with it?*    
**A:** Update your Wii U to 5.5.1, either by using a game update or Wupinstaller and Nintendo update files. 
<br><br>
<a name="faq_updates" />**Q:** *Now that Nintendo is ending production of the Wii U, does that mean no more updates?*    
**A:** They just released one (July 18th), so you could say that there might be more updates coming. On the other hand, it's unlikely Nintendo will support a console that they themselves consider abandoned with another update. The real answer is that we don't know, so it's better to leave dualhax on or disable your internet connection on the console altogether.
<br><br>
<a name="faq_updatemocha" />**Q:** *How do I update to the latest Mocha CFW?*    
**A:** Download the latest release of [Mocha CFW](https://github.com/dimok789/mocha/releases/latest), then copy `mocha.elf` from the Mocha CFW `.zip` to the `/wiiu/apps/mocha/` folder on your SD card (overwrite the existing file)
<br><br>
<a name="faq_risky" />**Q:** *How risky is hacking my console?*    
**A:** Bricks are extremely rare and usually caused by skipping instructions or otherwise not following instructions.
<br><br>
<a name="faq_homebrew" />**Q:** *Can I run awesome homebrew and emulators with this?*    
**A:** Yes! This not only enables the Homebrew Launcher, but it also will give you hacks on all versions, which means you keep it forever, even with updates.
<br><br>
<a name="faq_regionfree" />**Q:** *Can I use this to play games from other regions?*    
**A:** Mocha CFW supports Region Free patches, which enables users to install games from any region without any extra modification or steps.
<br><br>
<a name="faq_updates" />**Q:** *Is it safe to update patched SysNAND?*    
**A:** No! You must always ensure that your internet settings include DNS servers that block updates just in case a new update is released!
<br><br>
<a name="faq_support" />**Q:** *Where should I go for support?*    
**A:** For support, ask for help at [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp).
<br><br>
<a name="faq_sdsize" />**Q:** *How big of an SD card do I need?*    
**A:** Your SD card must be at least 64GB in size if you have a black Wii U (32GB) model. If you have a white (8GB) Wii U model, your SD card needs to be at least 16GB in size.
<br><br>
<a name="faq_NNID" />**Q:** *Can I keep my NNID?*    
**A:** If you start with an NNID and follow every step, you will end up keeping your NNID at the end.
<br><br>
<a name="faq_nopc" />**Q:** *Can I do this without a computer (e.g. an Android phone)?*    
**A:** All you need is the ability to put files on an SD card!
