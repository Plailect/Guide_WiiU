title: "Homebrew Launcher"

The Homebrew Launcher is a homebrew application that lists and allows the launching of other homebrew applications from the SD card.
{: .notice}

We launch this using the Wii U's built in browser, so your Wii U will need to be able to access the internet.

## For 5.5.0 & 5.5.1

#### Instructions

1. Launch the browser on your device
1. Go to the browser settings and select "Reset Save Data"
  + This will prevent issues with the browser exploit
  + This will also delete all save data including settings, history, and bookmarks
1. Return to the browser
1. Go to `http://loadiine.ovh`
  + You may want to bookmark this address to save time on typing in the future
1. Ensure that the drop down box shows "Homebrew Launcher 1.4 (5.5.0 - 5.5.1)", then press "Submit"
  + This may take many tries
  + In some situations, the "Homebrew Launcher 1.3 (5.3.2 - 5.4.0 - 5.5.0 - 5.5.1)" option may be more reliable for launching the Homebrew Launcher
  + If it freezes, just force the console to power off by holding the power button, then try again
1. Your console should load the Homebrew Launcher

If you would prefer to buy a cheap exploitable game to launch your Custom Firmware automatically at boot *(or already own one of the DS virtual console games listed)*, continue to [Haxchi](haxchi).

If you would prefer to launch your Custom Firmware using the browser on every boot to save money, continue to [Mocha CFW](mocha-cfw).

## For 5.5.2

The method of entering the Homebrew Launcher through a broswer exploit is extremely unstable and unreliable, at the time of this writing. That being said, please get a Haxchi-compatible game before following attempting to run a browser exploit (instructions below). Using Mocha CFW is not recommended, since the broswer exploit required to enter the Homebrew Launcher and run Mocha, is unreliable. Getting Haxchi would allow you to enter the Homebrew Launcher from the home menu with an almost 100% guaranteed success rate.
