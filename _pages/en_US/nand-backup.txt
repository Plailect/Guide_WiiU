### Required Reading

This is an optional page which will create a backup of your NAND on your SD card, which will allow you to restore your device using a hardmod in the case of a brick.

If you have a black Wii U (32GB) model, your SD card must be at least 64GB in size. If you have a white (8GB) Wii U model, your SD card must be at least 16GB in size.

Note that Mocha CFW users should follow these instructions after a reboot *without* running Mocha CFW (using the browser based Homebrew Launcher) to prevent Wii U NAND Dumper from freezing.

Before starting, you may want to check your SD card for errors using [H2testw (Windows)](h2testw-(windows)), [F3 (Linux)](f3-(linux)), or [F3X (Mac)](f3x-(mac))!
