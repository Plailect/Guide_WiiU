### Required Reading

The Homebrew Launcher is a homebrew application that lists and allows the launching of other homebrew applications from the SD card.

We launch this using the Wii U's built in browser, so your Wii U will need to be able to access the internet.

### Instructions

#### Section I - Preparing Browser

1. Launch the browser on your device
1. Go to the browser settings and select "Reset Save Data"
  + This will prevent issues with the browser exploit
  + This will also delete all save data including settings, history, and bookmarks
1. Return to the browser

#### Section II (i) - Versions 5.5.0 & 5.5.1

1. Go to `http://loadiine.ovh`
  + You may want to bookmark this address to save time on typing in the future
1. Ensure that the drop down box shows "Homebrew Launcher 1.4 (5.5.0 - 5.5.1)", then press "Submit"
  + This may take many tries
  + In some situations, the "Homebrew Launcher 1.3 (5.3.2 - 5.4.0 - 5.5.0 - 5.5.1)" option may be more reliable for launching the Homebrew Launcher
  + If it freezes, just force the console to power off by holding the power button, then try again
1. Your console should load the Homebrew Launcher

#### Section II (ii) - Version 5.5.2

1. Open the browser curtains
  + This improves the success rate of the 5.5.2 browser exploit
1. Go to `http://u.drg.li/`
  + You may want to bookmark this address to save time on typing in the future
1. Select "2" for the first exploit attempt
  + This may take many tries
  + If it freezes, just force the console to power off by holding the power button, then try a different number
  + You may need to try all exploit numbers more than once before one works
1. Your console should load the Homebrew Launcher

### Methods

___

#### Mocha CFW

This method requires that you rerun the web exploit used above *after every reboot*. It is not recommended that you use this on 5.5.2 as that version's web exploit is extremely unreliable.

#### Haxchi

This method uses a cheap exploitable DS Virtual Console game to launch your Custom Firmware automatically at boot. This is *essentially required* for users on 5.5.2 as the web exploit for that version is extremely unreliable.
