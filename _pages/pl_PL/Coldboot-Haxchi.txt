CBHC (Coldboot Haxchi) changes your default system title to make your SysNAND launch the DS virtual console game by default instead of the system menu, which will then load patched SysNAND.

This page is optional. Regular Haxchi works just fine as is; this just offers extra convenience. If you would like to skip Haxchi, continue to [Homebrew Launcher (Channel)](homebrew-launcher-(channel)).
