This will allow you to dump your discs to a format you can install for the purpose of playing them without needing the disc.

If you are planning to use an external hard drive to install your dumped discs on, note the following:

  + You cannot use the same hard drive for vWii and Wii U games.
  + The Wii U can only utilize up to 2TB of an external hard drive, even if the drive itself has a larger capacity.
  + Formatting an external hard drive for use with a Wii U will erase its contents.
  + If you are using an external HDD that does not have its own power source, then you will need a [Y-cable](http://amzn.to/2mjQjin).

### What you need

* A Wii U that can access patched SysNAND (Mocha CFW, Haxchi, CBHC, etc)
* 25GB of free space on your SD card
