{: .notice--success}

External hard drives must be connected to the upper back USB port of the Wii U to be detected by vWii. This cannot be the same external hard drive you use for Wii U games. If you are using an external HDD that does not have its own power source, then you will need a [Y-cable](http://amzn.to/2mjQjin).

Ensure any `.wad` files (channels, forwarders, games, etc) you install are formatted to [work properly with vWii](https://gbatemp.net/threads/340226/) first. If you install a `.wad` formatted for a regular Wii console, you will brick the vWii which will require a vWii NAND backup to restore.

{: .notice--danger}

Removing `.wad` files manually without knowing what you are doing will brick your vWii.
