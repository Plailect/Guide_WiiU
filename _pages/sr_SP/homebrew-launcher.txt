### Required Reading

The Homebrew Launcher is a homebrew application that lists and allows the launching of other homebrew applications from the SD card.

We launch this using the Wii U's built in browser, so your Wii U will need to be able to access the internet.

### Instructions

#### Section I - Preparing Browser

1. Launch the browser on your device

  + This will prevent issues with the browser exploit
  + This will also delete all save data including settings, history, and bookmarks
1. Return to the browser

#### Section II - Homebrew Launcher

1. If your device is on firmware version 5.5.2, open the browser curtains
  + This improves the success rate of the 5.5.2 browser exploit
1. Go to `usploit.hacks.guide`
  + You may want to bookmark this address to save time on typing in the future
1. Select "Run Homebrew Launcher" for the first exploit attempt
  + This may take many tries
