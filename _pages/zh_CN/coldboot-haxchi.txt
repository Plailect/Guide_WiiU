### 必读事项

CBHC (冷启动 Haxchi) 将会把你的默认系统菜单程序修改成你的 DS 虚拟主机 (virtual console) 游戏。 这会让你的设备在开机时自动进入自制系统。

这个漏洞比普通的 Haxchi 略危险一些，因为 DS 虚拟主机游戏将是你Wii U的 *命根子*。 如果你删除了游戏或者漏洞被移除，CBHC 将会导致你的设备 _砖机_！

{% capture notice-1 %}
你 _必须_ 事先安装好了 Haxchi 之后才能继续。 如果你不， 那么准备玩砖头吧。

Your Haxchi DS virtual console game MUST be on the internal memory of your Wii U. If it is on a USB drive, you will BRICK!

Your Haxchi DS virtual console game MUST be a LEGITIMATE (non-pirated) copy or you will BRICK!

### Instructions

#### Section I - NAND Backup

{% capture notice-1 %}
This is an optional section which will create a backup of your device's internal NAND memory on your SD card, which will allow you to restore your device in the case of a brick.

If you have a black Wii U (32GB) model, your SD card must be at least 64GB in size. If you have a white (8GB) Wii U model, your SD card must be at least 16GB in size.
{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

{% capture notice-1 %}
It is not possible to brick your device by installing CBHC as long as *all instructions and warnings are followed*. This, combined with the strict SD card requirements and extremely slow NAND dumping speed, means that creating a NAND backup is currently an optional step

If you accept the risk of installing CBHC without a NAND backup, skip this section.
