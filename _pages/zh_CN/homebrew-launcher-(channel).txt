#### Section II - Blocking System Updates

Note that, to access the eShop with these DNS addresses set, you must first run NNU-Patcher through the Homebrew Launcher. Additionally note that NNU-Patcher is a temporary patch and will need to be ran again if you need to access the eShop after a reboot.

Note that, unless you block updates with this method on all current and future connections, updates on the Wii U are performed *automatically* and *cannot* be disabled.
